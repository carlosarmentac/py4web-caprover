1.  [Get started with Caprover on your VPS and your CLI](https://caprover.com/docs/get-started.html)
2.  Create a new app named `flask` (or anything else you like) in the `Caprover interface`
3.  Inside the `HTTP Settings` section of the new app enable HTTPS and select `Force HTTPS by redirecting all HTTP traffic to HTTPS`
4.  On your local machine, clone this repository and `cd` into it `git clone https://github.com/carlosarmentac/py4web-caprover.git && cd py4web-caprover`
5.  Provide a PY4WEB dashboard Password: Edit "Dockerfile" file and change line 6:

        ARG password=none
6.  Need aditional Python libraries? Add it in "requirements.txt" file:

        psycopg2-binary
        # These libraries are required to be in "requirements.txt" file.
        # Other extra libraries like "mysql" or "requests"  must be added manually depending on your needs.

7.  Run `caprover deploy` and select your server and the app you just created
    - If this command doesn't exist, make sure that you followed [Step 3 of Getting Started with Caprover](https://caprover.com/docs/get-started.html#step-3-install-caprover-cli)
